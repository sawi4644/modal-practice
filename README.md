# modal-practice

This practice is done with JavaScript through a Udemy course. Working through sharpening my skills and practicing the mix of JavaScript and CSS. I enjoy modals and the functionality of them so I believe it is beneficial to practice.

Feel free to take a look behind the hood to see what code I used for this simple modal practice.
